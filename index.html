            Falling down, down, down, 
            My mind is a blank,
            My head is spinning around and around,
            As I go deep into the funnel of love.
            It's such a crazy, crazy feeling,
            I get weak in the knees,
            My poor old head is a reelin',
            As I go deep into the funnel of love.
            I tried and I tried, to run and hide,
            I even tried to run away,
            You just can't run from the funnel of love, 
            It's gonna get you someday.
